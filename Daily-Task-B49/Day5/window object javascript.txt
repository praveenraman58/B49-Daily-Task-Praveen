window object;

      The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

      All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

      Global variables are properties and functions are methods of the window object.

     Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:

  syntax;   

     window.document.getElementById("header"); this is same   document.getElementById("header");


Window Size;

      Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.

Both properties return the sizes in pixels;

     window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
     window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

syntax;

    let w = window.innerWidth;
    let h = window.innerHeight;

 Window Methods;

     window.open() - open a new window
     window.close() - close the current window
     window.moveTo() - move the current window
     window.resizeTo() - resize the current window
